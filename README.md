Machine Learning Templates
------------

Introduction
------------
This repo is to hold all of my machine learning and data mining templates for educational and practical uses. Any collaboration is welcome! :). All programs shall be written 
in python3 using multiple machine learning libraries such as numpy, panda, tensorflow, etc. Please email me at leduylamc@gmail.com for any bugs.
